## About me
<font size="3">My name is Artemiy.I'm 17 years old.I live in Belarus,in the city of Minsk.
I am also a student of the Belarusian State University of Informatics
and Radioelectronics.</font> </br>
---
I am a 1st year student.I study programming and web development at the university level.</br>

I really like to study these disciplines and since I am new to this field, I decided to increase my knowledge by enrolling in RSSCHOOL courses.

It seems to me that I have all the necessary qualities to do this business, such as:
 * Responsibility
 * Patience
 * Industriousness 
   
I stick to this phrase in my life:
>"Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do." ***Nelson Mandela***

Now, I want to tell you a little bit about my hobbies.
I like to do sports, to be more precise, workout. 
Because I think that to be always healthy, you need to always exercise.
Also, in addition, you get a beautiful and toned body.</br>

I also like to shoot videos on a social network like tiktok.
I got unreal pleasure and vibe in the process of shooting.
So far, I don't have a lot of results and a lot of subscribers, but I believe that everything is ahead and all this can be achieved.

***That's all I wanted to say about myself. Thanks for your attention!***
